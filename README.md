# 1. What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python
         Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Being a general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost
         any type of application with the right tools/libraries. Additionally, python supports objects, modules, threads, exception-handling, and 
         automatic memory management which help in modelling real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems.

    Benefits of using Python:

        Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces
        the cost of program maintenance. Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is completely open-source, and supports third-party packages
        encouraging modularity and code reuse.
                   Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, attract a huge community of developers for Rapid 
        Application Development and deployment
        
# 2. What is an Interpreted language?
      An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line. Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby are prime examples of           Interpreted languages. Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly from the source code, with no intermediary compilation step.        
      
# 3. What does sequence mean and which three types of data fall into this category?
     A sequence data type is a collection of objects ordered by a specific position. In Python, Strings, lists, and tuples are the data types 
     based on sequences. The Sequences share common sequence operations, such as indexing, concatenation, and slicing, but also have type-specific
     method calls..
     
# 4.  What are operators?
      Operators are required to perform various operations on data. They are special symbols that are required to carry out arithmetic and logical
      operations. The values on which the operator operates are called operands.  So, if we say 10/5=2
         Here '/' is the operator that performs division and 10 and 5 are the operands. Python has the following operators defined for
          various operations:

                  Arithmetic Operators
                  Relational Operators
                  Logical/Boolean Operators
                  Assignment Operators
                  Bitwise Operators
                  Membership Operators
                  Identity Operators
                  
# 5.   Which conditional statements are available in Python ?
            Conditional statements are the programming statements which alter the course of execution based on a condition.
            Like other functional programming languages, Python has following conditional statements.

                   If
                   If-Else
                   elif
         Conditional Statements are also called Control Statements.
         
# 6.  What are the mutable builtin datatypes available ?
         Mutable datatype are those

         List
         Sets
         Dictionaries
         
# 7.  What are the immutable builtin datatypes available ?
         Immutable datatypes are those

         Strings
         Tuples
         Numbers
         
# 8. What are logical operators?

         Logical operators are generally used in control statements like if and while. They are used to control program flow. The logical operator
         evaluates a condition and returns “True” or “False” depending on whether the condition evaluates to True or False. Three logical operators
         in Python are as follows:

         ‘and’
         ‘or’ and
         ‘not’
         
# 9. What are membership operators?

         The membership operators are used to check if a value exists in a sequence or not.
         Two types of membership operators are as follows:

         in: returns true if a value is found in a sequence
         not in: returns true if a value is not found in a sequence
         
# 10.  What are identity operators?
         Identity operators are used to verifying whether two values are on the same part of the memory or not. There are two types of identity 
         operators:

         is: return true if two operands are identical
         is not: returns true if two operands are not identical         
         
# 11. What is function in Python?

         Python Functions – Functions are a way of keeping the code organized in a modular fashion. There are lot of benefits in doing so. Some of
         them are :

        a.  An action that is required to be performed multiple times during the lifetime of application, could be encapsulated as a function for
            code re-usability, thus reducing the code length and redundancy.
        b.  As functions are the result of an organized code, they help in maintenance and following up with the code easily.

# 12. What is the difference between a = 10 and a= = 10?
         The expression a = 10 assigns the value 10 to variable a, whereas a == 10 checks if the value of a is equal to 10 or not. If yes then it            returns ‘True’ else it will return ‘False’.

# 13. What is the Python Dictionary
         Python Dictionary is a collection. It can contain multiple elements.

         Python Dictionary is un-ordered. The elements in the dictionary are not stored in a sequence. For example, if you add an item to a
         dictionary, it can be inserted at any index.

         Python Dictionary is changeable. You can update an item using its key, delete an item, or add an item. The original dictionary gets
         updated. Simply put, Python Dictionary is mutable.

         Python Dictionary is indexed. You can access a specific key:value pair using key as index.
         
# 14.  What is an expression?
         A logical line of code that we write while programing, is called expressions. An expression can be broken into operator and operands. It
         is therefore said that an expression is a combination of one or more operands and zero or more operators that are together used to compute
         a value.
                  For example:
                           a = 6
                           a + b = 9
                           8/7        
         
# 15. What is Python Lists
         Python List is an ordered collection of elements and you can store objects of any datatype in the list.         
         
# 16. What are Python Modules?
         Files containing Python codes are referred to as Python Modules. This code can either be classes, functions or variables and saves the
         programmer time by providing the predefined functionalities when needed. It is a file with “.py” extension containing an executable code.

         Commonly used built modules are listed below:
                  os
                  sys
                  data time
                  math
                  random
                  JSON 
                  
# 17. What are python namespaces?
         A Python namespace ensures that object names in a program are unique and can be used without any conflict. Python implements these
         namespaces as dictionaries with ‘name as key’ mapped to its respective ‘object as value’.

         Let’s explore some examples of namespaces:

         Local Namespace:- consists of local names inside a function. It is temporarily created for a function call and gets cleared once the
                         function returns.
         Global Namespace:- consists of names from various imported modules/packages that are being used in the ongoing project. It is created once
                          the package is imported into the script and survives till the execution of the script.
         Built-in Namespace:- consists of built-in functions of core Python and dedicated built-in names for various types of exceptions.                 
                  
# 18. Is indentation required in Python?
         Indentation in Python is compulsory and is part of its syntax.

         All programming languages have some way of defining the scope and extent of the block of codes. In Python, it is indentation. Indentation
         provides better readability to the code, which is probably why Python has made it compulsory.                  
                  
 # 19. How does break, continue, and pass work?
         These statements help to change the phase of execution from the normal flow that is why they are termed loop control statements.

         Python break: This statement helps terminate the loop or the statement and pass the control to the next statement.

         Python continue: This statement helps force the execution of the next iteration when a specific condition meets, instead of terminating
                          it.

         Python pass: This statement helps write the code syntactically and wants to skip the execution. It is also considered a null operation as
                      nothing happens when you execute the pass statement.                 
                  
# 20. Is Python fully object oriented?
         Python does follow an object-oriented programming paradigm and has all the basic OOPs concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and
         more, with the exception of access specifiers. Python doesn’t support strong encapsulation (adding a private keyword before data members).
         Although, it has a convention that can be used for data hiding, i.e., prefixing a data member with two underscores.
