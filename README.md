# 1. What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python
         Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Being a general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost
         any type of application with the right tools/libraries. Additionally, python supports objects, modules, threads, exception-handling, and 
         automatic memory management which help in modelling real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems.

    Benefits of using Python:

        Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces
        the cost of program maintenance. Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is completely open-source, and supports third-party packages
        encouraging modularity and code reuse.
                   Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, attract a huge community of developers for Rapid 
        Application Development and deployment
        
# 2. What is an Interpreted language?
      An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line. Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby are prime examples of           Interpreted languages. Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly from the source code, with no intermediary compilation step.        
      
# 3. What does sequence mean and which three types of data fall into this category?
     A sequence data type is a collection of objects ordered by a specific position. In Python, Strings, lists, and tuples are the data types 
     based on sequences. The Sequences share common sequence operations, such as indexing, concatenation, and slicing, but also have type-specific
     method calls..
     
# 4.  What are operators?
      Operators are required to perform various operations on data. They are special symbols that are required to carry out arithmetic and logical
      operations. The values on which the operator operates are called operands.  So, if we say 10/5=2
         Here '/' is the operator that performs division and 10 and 5 are the operands. Python has the following operators defined for
          various operations:

                  Arithmetic Operators
                  Relational Operators
                  Logical/Boolean Operators
                  Assignment Operators
                  Bitwise Operators
                  Membership Operators
                  Identity Operators
